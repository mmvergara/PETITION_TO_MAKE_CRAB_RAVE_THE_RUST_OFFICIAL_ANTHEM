# Petition: Crab Rave as Rust's Anthem ðŸ¦€

Today, we gather to discuss a matter of utmost importance: the dire need for Rust to adopt "Crab Rave" as its official theme song.

The goal is to convince the rust team to put "Crab Rave" in the **Official Rust Documentation**.

## Signatures (Open up a PR to sign) ðŸ¦€

By signing this petition, I pledge to dance like a crab every time I compile Rust code.
